# odin-recipes
Hello and welcome to Odin Recipes!

The purpose of this project is to showcase my current (entry-level) skills I am learning and developing in HTML. This will include use of header, body, prioritized headers, emboldening and italicizing text, embedding images, and may include linking to other pages within my directory and other sites outside of my site's directory.
